## How to
### convert from txt →  db
⚠️ All existing tables in the database completely delete during importing!
To import dictionary data from text files into a database, you must first define **Import Path** (or select "Use text files from Github") and **Postgres URI**. By default, the Postgres database is used, but you can configure any other supported by SQLAlchemy.

### convert from txt → access
To import dictionary data from text files into a Access file, you must first define **Import Path** (or select "Use text files from Github") and **Access URI**. You should use [latest *.mdb file](https://github.com/torrua/LOD/raw/master/source/LoglanDictionary.mdb) from from the **LOD** project materials.
